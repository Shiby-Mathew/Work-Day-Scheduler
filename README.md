## Description

```md
A simple daily planner application that allows user to save events for each hour of the day
(9am-5pm). This app will run in the browser and it features dynamically updated HTML,CSS along with BootStrap powered by jQuery.I used Day.js to work with date and time.
```

## User Story

```md

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
